• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
	A gitignore file is a file where you list down all the patterns to match with file names which 
	you don't want Git to automatically add or even show as being untracked.
	For a java project, it is not required to maintain the compiled class files, log files, package files and virtual machine crash log files.
	So we can add the following patterns to the gitignore file :
		*.class
		*.log
		*.ctxt
		*.jar
		*.war
		*.nar
		*.ear
		*.zip
		*.rar
		hs_err_pid*
		
• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
	When you try to merge a branch say B1, with a branch, say B2 and if you can reach to the B2 with B1's commit history, 
	Git just simply move the B1 pointer to point to B2 as there is no divergent work to merge. This is known as a fast-forward.
	
• Why should you have different branches?
	To protect the master branch (which should contain the working code at all times) from unwanted commits. Master branch should always be deployable. 
	Hense to carry out the development activities we should use the branches.	
	
• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
	Usually, we have one remote repository under the name "origin" which is automatically created at the time of cloning.
